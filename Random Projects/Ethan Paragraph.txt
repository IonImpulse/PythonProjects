The pillory attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese creates dissonance between her origins and her present.

Before this attack, Kazuko already had questioned who she really was, and what that meant. Her trip to Japan opened her eyes to the differences between the US and Japan, specifically the differences in culture. She had experienced racism before, when she and her mother attempted to rent another house. They had gone door-to-door asking if places that were marked “For Rent” were available. Every single time, the owners made up excuses as to not rent to them. Later, at home, Kazuko hears her mother talking to her dad, telling him that they were not able to rent anything, and that she suspected it was due to their Japanese origins. Kazuko realizes in that moment that she was not just an American in America, but also Japanese.

Once the attack on Pearl Harbor commences, confusion and fear take hold. Some Japanese Americans believe that it is simply propaganda, but Kazuko knows better. She felt that “An old wound opened up again, and I found myself shrinking inwardly from my Japanese blood, the blood of an enemy” (146). 

Her “old wound” opening up could very well be referencing when she and her mother were refused by several landlords, as that was a very impactful moment that would have left a scar on her. She doesn’t want to renounce her Japaneseness, but she also doesn’t want her Americanness taken away either. She knew that her “Japanese blood” was forgin and scary to some Americans, for it was now not only different, but “the blood of an enemy.” She feels stuck between her origins and her current existence. 

What this shows is that it is impossible to escape both your history and your present. When Kazuko’s past puts her in a bad position, she cannot run from it, being forced to accept it for all the good and the bad.
