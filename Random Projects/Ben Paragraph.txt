Through the course of the story, we see that kazuko dislikes and distrusts authoritative figures in her life. When her mom sends her and her brother to a Japanese school, it is difficult for her to adjust to the rules of strict adherence and stringent etiquette. As she meets her new principal, she describes, “his black marble eyes crushed us into quivering silence.” (Sone 21) She establishes his authoritative presence and his effect on the students. The description of “black marble eyes” evokes the qualities of an emotionless and cold rock. Granite is uncaring and cold to the touch. So too are her principal’s eyes. They “crush” Kazuko into “quivering silence”. They do not simply cause her to become silent. They forcefully crush her against her will. The use of the word “quivering” illustrates her fear and apprehension in the situation. Kazuko describes her principal in a markedly negative light. She highlights his stoney features and powerful presence not as a virtue but almost as one would describe a super-villain. She goes on to note that her “will was completely dissolved” and that she felt as if in “a terrible nightmare.” Her reaction to this strict and powerful figure reveals her attitude toward authority in general. She dislikes having authority exercised over her and when that happens, she feels as if she were “dissolved” and “crushed”. These words represent a breakdown in structure. Kazuko clearly dislikes this exercising of power and seems to resent authority figures for it. Her descriptions of authority figures in her life reveal this attitude which permeates the whole story. From her dad’s unwillingness to pay bail to their experiences in the internment camp, stubbornness and disliking of authority are defining characteristics that inform Kazuko’s character.
