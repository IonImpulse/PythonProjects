We stay up until 4:00 in the morning, barely hanging on to sanity, wondering why you didn't sleep, yet knowing it was futile in the end. We will all die one day, no matter how immortal we think we might be. The universe knows no compassion, no mercy. We will all succumb to the energy being ripped out of the very fabric of the universe, growing colder with each passing second. Matter condenses, gravity acts, and all life, space, emotions, thoughts, energy, light, matter, and time will be ripped into the ever consuming black hole of pure death. Try as we might, there is no escaping this fate. No way to stop heat from slowly draining our universe from everything that once made what it was. Nothing will ever mark our existence, and our lives will be as meaningless as the dust particles we are.

Or, yea know, go to bed
